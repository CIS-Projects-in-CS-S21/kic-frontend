# Keeping It Casual

## Release v4.0.0

### Project Abstract
We propose a social media application focused on mental health awareness that keeps things much more casual than common sharing platforms. In the current environment, an unhealthy attachment has grown for many when it comes to their self-esteem, with the use of likes, comments, and views aiding many in validation of themselves. With Keeping It Casual (KIC), users are able to create accounts, post content, and follow others without a dependency developing and instead can focus on the simple enjoyment of a profile curated by them, a feed of their friends, and photos/videos posted without fear of judgement. While they are able to tag their friends and family in posts and find friends through an algorithm based on like-users, KIC does not allow for likes, views, and followers to be publicly displayed, and also provides multiple mental health boosting features. These include scheduled postings from mental health counselors on each userâ€™s feed, a location-based service where users can find mental health professionals near them, and also a mood tracker to allow users to monitor their mental health. 

### Release Notes (v4.0.0)
- Users can create a new account or log into existing accounts. Users can specify their first and last names, a username, password, email, birth date, city, and bio.
- Users can access a settings page that allows them to upload a profile picture, change their bio, toggle their account privacy, and add triggers to filter.
- Users can go back to the previous page or sign out of the app via the header.
- Users can see a feed with their friends' posts. If a user has triggers, any posts with that trigger will be filtered from the feed.
- Users have a profile page that display their profile picture, username, and bio. Clicking on other users' icons or usernames will display that user's page.
- Users can view friend recommendations in the Explore tab. Friend recommendations are curated depending on the user's current friend list.
- Users can search for other users by username.
- Users have a public friends list. Users can send friend requests to other users and see their own pending friend requests. They can accept or deny these requests.
- Users can view and upload images and videos on web and mobile, which are displayed on their profile page. Users can add captions, tags, and triggers to their post, as well as delete the post if they wish.
- Users can view and comment on other users' posts, unless the other user has a private account. A user can only view and/or comment on a private user's post if they are friends.
- Comments are filtered for profanity.
- Users can delete their own comments as well as any comments on their own posts. They can disable commenting on their own posts on an individual basis, which hides existing comments and prevents any new comments from being added.
- Users can keep track of their mental health through the Mental Health Tracker, which allows users to rate their mental wellbeing for a given day and add a brief journal entry. Users can view, track, and delete their entries.
- If a user is detected to have a series of low mental health scores, they will begin to see positivity posts on their feed. The lower their mental health score, the more frequent the positivity posts appear.
- Users can search for nearby mental health professionals in the Mental Health Tracker. By entering their zip code or city, they can see a list of mental health professionals near their location.
