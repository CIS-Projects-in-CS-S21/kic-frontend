# Keeping It Casual

## Release v3.0.0

### Project Abstract
We propose a social media application focused on mental health awareness that keeps things much more casual than common sharing platforms. In the current environment, an unhealthy attachment has grown for many when it comes to their self-esteem, with the use of likes, comments, and views aiding many in validation of themselves. With Keeping It Casual (KIC), users are able to create accounts, post content, and follow others without a dependency developing and instead can focus on the simple enjoyment of a profile curated by them, a feed of their friends, and photos/videos posted without fear of judgement. While they are able to tag their friends and family in posts and find friends through an algorithm based on like-users, KIC does not allow for likes, views, and followers to be publicly displayed, and also provides multiple mental health boosting features. These include scheduled postings from mental health counselors on each user’s feed, a location-based service where users can find mental health professionals near them, and also a mood tracker to allow users to monitor their mental health. 

### Release Notes (v3.0.0)
